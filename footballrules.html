                    A kick-off starts the match, restarts play after a goal is scored,
                    and begins the second half. All players must be in their own half
                    and opponents must be at least 9.15 meters away from the ball.

                <p>
                    A foul is committed when a player uses excessive force, trips,
                    pushes, holds an opponent, or deliberately handles the ball.
                    Fouls may result in free kicks, penalties, yellow cards, or red cards.
                    Direct free kicks offences are the more common type of foul. If a direct free kick is awarded in the penalty area of the offending player's team, a penalty kick is awarded.
                    A yellow card is shown by the referee to indicate that a player has been officially cautioned.[1]: Law 12.3  The player's details are then recorded by the referee in a small notebook; hence a caution is also known as a "booking". 
                    A red card is shown by a referee to signify that a player must be sent off.[1]: Law 12.3  A player who has been sent off is required to leave the field of play immediately, must take no further part in the game and cannot be replaced by a substitute, forcing their team to play with one fewer player.

                    Extra time consists of two halves of 15 minutes each and is played
                    when a match must have a winner. There is a short break between halves,
                    and no golden goal rule is used.This missing time is compensated in soccer at the end of each half with what’s known as “added time”, “injury time”, or “stoppage time”. In this article, you’ll find everything you need to know about the rule, including what it is, how long it is, and records through the ages.
                    During the game, the referee keeps track of any stoppages in play. At the end of each half, they decide how many minutes should be added before notifying the fourth official of this amount via their headset. The fourth official then displays this number to everyone on the pitch and in the crowd by holding up an electronic board.
If further delays occur during the added time, the referee can allow more time to be played. There is no fixed upper limit in this case. However, the referee cannot reduce the added time once they have communicated it to the fourth official. Once set, players must comply with whatever added time has been decided.
If the referee makes a timing error when adding on injury time in the first half, they may not compensate for this by extending the added time in the second half. If this happens, the time would simply be lost. Added time is also allowed at the end of each half when extra time is played (note: added time and extra time are different things in soccer).

                <p>
                    Teams are allowed a limited number of substitutions per match.
                    Substituted players cannot return to the game, and substitutions
                    must be made during stoppages with the referee’s permission.
                    A substitution can only occur when the game is stopped and with the referee’s permission
The player being substituted must:
leave the pitch at the nearest point on the boundary line or quickly at the halfway line (unless already off the pitch)
go straight to the bench/technical area or the dressing room and remain off the pitch
The substitute must only enter the pitch:
after receiving the referee’s signal
after the substituted player has left the pitch
at the halfway line
Once the substituted player has left the pitch and the substitute has entered the pitch, the substitution is completed and cannot be changed (except in the case of rolling/return substitutions)
