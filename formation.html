                    The 4-3-3 formation focuses on attacking width and high pressing.
                    It allows wingers to stretch the defense while a three-man midfield
                    controls possession and tempo. Ideal for aggressive, attacking teams.
                    Midfield Control: The 4-3-3 makes use of three highly specialised midfielders, and this makes for a rather oppressive midfield. When utilised properly, a 4-3-3 provides the most controlling midfield in football, as unlike in other formations where the midfield players may be required to carry out several roles, the midfielders in the 4-3-3 have the sole task of setting the tempo of the game and linking defence to attack.
Attack: The 4-3-3 gives the opportunity for up to seven players to join in the attack. Wide forwards who can opt to roam on the touchline, or cut inside the box, with fullbacks making overlapping runs. This adds a touch of unpredictability to the attack, as the opposition defenders are forced to be on alert against both attacking outlets.
Defence: The 4-3-3 is primarily designed for attack, and in the event of both fullbacks opting for the overlap at the same time, the team is left exposed with only three men at the back –the two defenders and the central defensive midfielder.
Stringent Technical Requirements: When simulating the 4-3-3 with our formation creator, it is important to understand that the three central midfielders needed are required to have high technical skills, a perfect fit between innovativeness and willingness to play specific roles.

                    The 4-4-2 is a classic balanced formation offering defensive stability
                    and two strikers for direct attacking play. It works well for teams
                    that prefer structure and quick transitions.
                    The 4-4-2 is built for the counter-attack, evidenced by the fact that most of the great counter-attacking teams in contemporary football use it — the Champions League-winning Manchester United team, and both Atletico Madrid and Leicester City when they won their respective leagues.
As the 4-4-2 makes use of two attackers – usually a Center Forward and a Striker, defending against it is particularly hard. Using two attackers means there’s a perpetual threat of having the opposition centre-backs in 1-v-1 situations, a situation which favours the attacker more often than not. This forces either one of the fullbacks or a midfielder to drop in and help out in defence, effectively creating more space for the team using the 4-4-2 to operate in.
The 4-4-2, when effectively used, can be one of the most defensive formations. The four defenders and midfielders can line up in two walls, one in front of the 18-yard box, and another in just before the half-way line, a tactic famously known as Two Banks of Four.
The greatest weakness of the 4-4-2 is the lack of control over the game, except in exceptional cases. Modern football has adapted spectacularly to the 4-4-2 by doing something simple — playing a three-man midfield. The 4-4-2, by default, makes use of two central midfielders who, almost always, cannot take control of the midfield area from a three-man midfield.
In an attempt to ensure that having an extra man committed to attack doesn’t leave the team defensively unbalanced, players in a 4-4-2 are usually the most hard working. The wide midfielders, especially, are required to always help out in defence, and one of the strikers is generally requested to assist in the press. This, while, effectively compensating for extra attacking flair, is strenuous to the players, and a decline in stamina may be noticed as the game wears down.

                    The 4-2-3-1 provides excellent defensive cover with two holding
                    midfielders while allowing creativity through three attacking
                    midfielders behind a lone striker.
                  Attack: The 4-2-3-1 makes use of four attacking players with the box-to-box having the potential to be the fifth. This means that in a counterattacking situation, the team playing the 4-2-3-1 will almost always have the numerical advantage.
Fluidity: The 4-2-3-1 boasts of a rather impressive ease of transition. While as many as five players can be dedicated to the attack, that number can just as easily change to six in defence. This fluidity in transition is what makes it so popular, as it is less susceptible to the threat of a counterattack.
Balance: The 4-2-3-1 is well balanced, having the potential for great attacking football or a masterpiece defensive performance depending on the manager’s game plan.
Finding the right personnel: The midfield of the 4-2-3-1 requires incredible specific personnel. The central defensive midfielder position, for example, requires a great passing range, decent athleticism, and a good footballing brain. The box-to-box midfield position requires stamina, good passing, and shot technique. If these requirements are not met, the 4-2-3-1 loses the balance which makes it so impressive.

                    The 3-5-2 formation focuses on midfield dominance and flexibility.
                    Wing-backs provide width while three central defenders maintain
                    defensive solidity and support build-up play.
